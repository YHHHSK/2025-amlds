# Research on Machine Learning-based Credit Risk Prediction Models and Algorithms
## Overview
This paper is based on the long-term customer credit data provided by the 2024 Sichuan Province Data Science and Statistical Modeling Competition. The data covers characteristic information from multiple dimensions such as demographic statistics, borrowing and repayment behaviors, as well as risk performance data after loan applications. 

 Starting from data preprocessing, data analysis, feature selection, dataset partitioning, LightGBM model construction, and effect evaluation, a credit risk prediction and identification model is developed to identify customer risks.
